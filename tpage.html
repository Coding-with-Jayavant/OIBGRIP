          <h2>superstar of Marathi cinema</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Laxmikant Berde was an Indian Marathi language film actor who appeared in several Marathi and Hindi movies., Berde started acting in small roles in Marathi stage plays. In 1983â€“84, he acquired his first major role in Purshottam Berde's Marathi stage play Tur Tur which became a hit and Berde's style of comedy was appreciated.[1]
                Berde made his movie debut with the 1984 Marathi movie Lek Chalali Sasarla.[2] Subsequently, he and actor Mahesh Kothare starred together in films Dhoom Dhadaka (1984) and De Danadan (1987). Both these movies became famous and helped Berde establish his trademark comedy style.[1][3]
                In most movies, he starred either alongside Kothare or with actor Ashok Saraf. The Berde-Saraf pair is recognized to be a successful lead actor pairing in Indian cinema.[4] Berde, along with Ashok Saraf, Sachin Pilgaonkar and Mahesh Kothare formed a successful quartet in Marathi films after acting together in the 1989 Marathi film Ashi Hi Banwa Banwi.[1]
                That decade will be best remembered by the Marathi film industry as the "Ashok-Lakshya" era. Both actors remained best friends until Berde died. In most movies, Berde was paired with actress and his future wife Priya Arun.
                Berde's first Hindi film was Sooraj Barjatya's Maine Pyar Kiya starring Salman Khan in 1989. Some of his other popular Hindi films include Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Mere Sapno Ki Rani, Aarzoo, Saajan, Beta, 100 Days and Anari. Berde also kept working as the lead actor in hit Marathi stage plays like Shantecha Karta Chalu Aahe and others.
                In 1992, Berde tried to break away from his comedy mould and acted in a serious role in the film Ek Hota Vidushak. However, the film was not a commercial success and Berde reverted to his trademark comedy, albeit disappointed with the film's failure.
                From 1985 to 2000, Berde acted in many other Marathi blockbusters such as Aamhi Doghe Raja Rani, Hamaal De Dhamaal, Balache Baap Brahmachari, Eka Peksha Ek, Bhootacha Bhau, Thartharat, Dhadakebaaz and Zapatlela.[3]
                Berde acted in the Marathi TV serial Nasti Aafat and "Gajra". Pachadlela (2004) was his last movie.[5]
